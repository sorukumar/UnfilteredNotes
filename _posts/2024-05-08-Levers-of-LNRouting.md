Two decades back, when I got exposed to credit risk modeling for a bank, I just loved the simplicity of below equation. 

$$
\text{Loss}(\$) = \text{Probability}(\text{Loss}) \times \text{Loss Given Default}(\$)
$$

$$
\text{Expected Loss ($)} = \text{PD (probablity of default)} \times \text{LGD (Loss given default)} \times \text{EAD (exposure at default)}
$$
