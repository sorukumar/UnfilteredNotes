When you are looking for a peer on LightningNetworkplus, you could either form a traingle or a pentagon. A traingle is formed 
The cycle structure of a graph can impact its quality in several ways:

-   Robustness: Longer cycles make the graph more robust, as there are more alternative paths between nodes if some edges fail. Shorter cycles like C3 are more vulnerable.[3](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1490053/what-is-the-difference-between-a-loop-cycle-and-strongly-connected-components-i)
-   Routing Efficiency: Longer cycles can allow more efficient routing, as there are more potential paths between nodes. Shorter cycles may limit routing options.[3](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1490053/what-is-the-difference-between-a-loop-cycle-and-strongly-connected-components-i)
-   Symmetry: Cycle graphs exhibit high symmetry, as any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex. This symmetry can simplify analysis and algorithms.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph)
1.  Complexity: The problem of finding a single simple cycle that covers each vertex exactly once (a Hamiltonian cycle) is much harder than finding a set of cycles that cover each edge. The length of the cycle affects the complexity of these problems.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_%28graph_theory%29)
2.  Cycle Detection Algorithms: The algorithms used to detect cycles in a graph, such as depth-first search, can be impacted by the cycle length. Shorter cycles may be easier to detect.[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_%28graph_theory%29)
