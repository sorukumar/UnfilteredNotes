Two decades ago while doing and learning credit risk modelling for a bank,  I stumbled into an equation I fell in love with

$$
\text{Expected Loss(\$)  } = \text{PD (probablity of default)} \times \text{LGD (Loss given default)} \times \text{EAD (exposure at default)}
$$

This equation is remarkable and seductive because it breaks down a complex problem into a bunch of smaller problems that are more solvable.
