While doing a course on Bayesian Stats decade back, I got exposed to the book, the lady tasting tea. I read it, and since then I have been fan of it, and have recommendaed it to anyone who have talked about statistics to me.

The book inspired me to think about timeline of statistical thoughts, and this post is an attemp to summarize my research so far.
