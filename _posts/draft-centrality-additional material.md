$\text{Katz Centrality}(v) = \alpha \sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij} x_j + \beta$

$\text{PageRank}(p_i) = \frac{1-d}{N} + d \sum_{p_j \in M(p_i)} \frac{\text{PageRank}(p_j)}{L(p_j)}$


This is an attemt to define centrality metrics in an intuitive way that would work for even your four legged kid, if you try. I'll also add some thoughts on relevance of the metric in context of Lightning network.
