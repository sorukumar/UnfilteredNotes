#  Health of Lightning network

The best set of metrics to gauge the health of Lighting network graph is actual metrics on total payment, failure rate and speed. Considering, we dont have that easily available, for now, we can live with below metrics that tells us the health of a graph.

These metrics come from the graph science literature. And, of course, Lighitng network graph has its own set of constraints and challenges, but, yet it would be great starting point.

In this post, we will lay out the metrics, and eventually, I'll add those in Plebdashboard.

Here is a list of metrics:

### 1. **Connectivity**

-   **Description**:  A well-connected graph ensures that there are multiple paths for transmitting data, which increases the reliability of data transfer.
-   **Metric**: Look at the number of connected components, the size of the largest connected component, and the average node degree.

### 2. **Path Length**

-   **Description**: The average shortest path length is crucial for data transmission as it affects the speed of communication between any two nodes.
-   **Metric**: Average shortest path length (mean geodesic distance) and diameter of the graph (the longest of all the shortest path lengths).

### 3. **Robustness**

-   **Description**: The ability of the graph to maintain connectedness and functionality when nodes or edges fail.
-   **Metric**: Measure the graph's resilience by simulating node or edge failures and observing how the graph's connectivity and average path length are affected.

### 4. **Throughput**

-   **Description**: The graph’s capacity to handle large amounts of data simultaneously without significant delays.
-   **Metric**: This can be indirectly measured by analyzing the graph’s degree distribution and bandwidth (which might be theoretical in some cases unless specified by the network’s physical or software design).

### 5. **Network Efficiency**

-   **Description**: Overall efficiency of the network in terms of both local and global efficiency.
-   **Metric**: Global efficiency (inverse of the average shortest path length) and local efficiency (measures efficiency of information transfer in localized clusters).

### 6. **Clustering Coefficient**

-   **Description**: Indicates the degree to which nodes in the graph tend to cluster together. High clustering can suggest robustness, as parallel paths can exist for data transmission.
-   **Metric**: Global and average local clustering coefficients.

### 7. **Centrality Measures**

-   **Description**: Important to identify critical nodes for maintaining fast and reliable communication.
-   **Metric**: Degree centrality (for node importance), betweenness centrality (nodes critical for bridging paths), and closeness centrality (nodes efficiently distributing data).

### 8. **Scalability**

-   **Description**: How well can the network grow? This is particularly important if the network needs to accommodate more nodes or heavier data flow without significant performance degradation.
-   **Metric**: This is more of a qualitative assessment, looking at how adding nodes or edges affects the metrics mentioned above.

### 9. **Load Balancing**

-   **Description**: The ability of the network to distribute traffic evenly among nodes to prevent any single node from becoming a bottleneck.
-   **Metric**: Variance in node degree and edge loads can be simulated under various traffic conditions to observe potential bottlenecks.

### Practical Comparison Steps:

-   **Simulation**: Run simulations on both graphs to see how data flows under various conditions, such as high traffic, node/edge failures, or rapid network scaling.
-   **Software Tools**: Use network analysis and simulation tools like NetworkX for Python, Gephi, or specialized simulation software that can model data flow and test network resilience under stress.

### Decision Criteria:

-   Choose the graph that demonstrates better performance across these metrics, particularly focusing on robustness, efficiency, and shortest paths if your main goal is to optimize for fast and reliable data transmission. The choice might also depend on specific operational requirements like fault tolerance, load capacity, or future scalability.

By focusing on these metrics, you can make a well-informed decision about which graph is more suitable for your data transmission needs, considering both the current performance and future adaptability of the network.
